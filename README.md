# FamilySpot
This frontend web application is a fictitious Family Reunion App. It's purpose is to show how to internalize and organzie browser code as well as to showcase how I like to work.

## Base Requirements

- Create a high-fidelity version of the FamilySpot main screen, which breaks responsively to mobile width. (As demonstrated in the sketch file).
- When you click the 'Edit Info' button, it launches a live edit modal. Changes to the modal should reflect on the screen after you click 'Save.'
- Don't worry about session management/account creation/login. It's fine to store data in localstorage, or even a global variable.

## Additional Features
- Using Everplan's [React Boilerplate](https://github.com/everplans/react-boilerplate).
- Useing frontend integration tests (mocha, jasmine, etc.). Also provided in Everplan's React Boilerplate
